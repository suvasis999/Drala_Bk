                    a. The Church: the Spirit of Truth Native American Church (the "Church") is a community of people who believe the same religious doctrine and are governed by ecclesiastical principles.

Church Entities: To satisfy temporal affairs needs and fulfill the purposes of the Church, a legal structure composed of various distinct legal entities may assist the Church throughout the world. These distinct legal entities (herein "Church entities") are legally separate from the Church. The Spirit of Truth Native American Church, a Missouri non-profit church corporation, together with one or more other Church entities, processes your personal data as responsible joint data controllers. Some Church entities may receive personal data as data processors to provide services to those Church entities that act as data controllers. At your written request, we will provide you with information as to which Church entities process your personal data.{' '}
