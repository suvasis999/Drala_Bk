          For thousands of years, the Creator's healing modalities have been used by native peoples. Now because of the spiritual wickedness in high places (Ephesians 6:12), governments around the world continue to make many of the Creator’s divine gifts illegal. (Just like peyote, ayahuasca, and many other plant remedies were classified illegal many decades ago, they are moving to take complete control over all of the natural and alternative healing modalities.).

          Because of the many losses of freedom, many people and Natural Healers
          run to the freedom of religion exemption to find safety. Sadly,
          because of the court cases where judges have dictated peoples’
          religious beliefs and the established rules that govern what your
          protection under these religions can be, those organizations have
          fallen short in their protection and many people have been harmed.

            Example Two: Many people have tried to use their religion as a legal defense for practicing their healing modalities. In times past a natural healer could say, “I am a Christian,” and then use that religion as a way to stop specific medical actions or allow them to perform specific healing treatments on others.

            This defense has failed in court and precedence has been established

            the Christian defense above, the judge can simply say, “I am a
            Christian too and I don’t believe the same way you do so your

            When asked about using religion as a defense, the honorable
            Judge Benjamin Zvenia said that he has never seen a church member
            (other than the Native American Church) win in court over the charge
            of practicing medicine without a license solely for religious
            exemption. For them to win they have always had to be licensed by a
            government-approved board for that healing modality.

          For thousands of years, the Native American religions did not dictate any official religious dogma over their members, ministers, and healers. Often different Native American Churches had conflicting beliefs, like different colors or totems used to represent the Medicine Wheel, but they would allow their followers to choose for themselves the way to worship. In February 1992 a press conference on Indigenous Religious Freedom was held where Reuben Snake said, “In 1492 from the Bering Straits to Terre de Fuego this part of Creation was a totally brown universe. And regardless of where our ancestors lived, whether it was the Alaskan tundra, or on the mountain tops, or on the desert floor, or in the rainforest, wherever they lived they had one world view, that there was a Creator of all things and he was responsible for the Creation. And that it was our responsibility and our duty to find our place within this Creation to live in peace and harmony. And I have yet to have proven to me that those people in those times ever tried to impress one another with their own particular spiritual beliefs and practices to say that, ‘My way is better than your way.’”

        <p id='paragraphStyle' className="p_text">
          Sadly, in modern times there has been a movement to control or
          restrict beliefs in some of the Native American Churches. Also, some
          Native American Churches or Government Recognized Tribes think they
          have the authority to dictate their opinions and beliefs to other
          Native American Churches.

          <p id='paragraphStyle' style={{ fontWeight: 800, color: '#AA3B3B', fontSize: '16px' }}>
            Example One: There are some Native American Churches that will not
            allow a “White Man” into their ceremony even though historically it
            has been proven that their ancestors did not follow that belief.
          </p>
          <p id='paragraphStyle' style={{ fontWeight: 800, color: '#AA3B3B', fontSize: '16px', }}>
            Example Two: Some established Native American Churches think that all other Native American Churches should hold or run Peyote Ceremonies the way they do. They also issue edicts claiming to restrict other ceremonial sacraments from other church organizations just because the practice was lost or not a part of their tribal culture. This is like the Catholic Church issuing edicts against the Baptist Church or the Jews issuing edicts against all of Christianity. This type of thinking is just silly and not a Spirit-based way of running things.
          </p>
          <p id='paragraphStyle' style={{ fontWeight: 800, color: '#AA3B3B', fontSize: '16px' }}>
            Example Three: The title of Native American Church has gotten the general misconception that it is a Peyote Religion. This is not the case. There are Native American Churches established in North America that have the direct “Indian Authority” that do not even use Peyote in their ceremonies. Just like there are numerous Christian Churches with different belief systems there are numerous Native American Churches with different general belief systems. The only requirement to be a “True Native American Church” is to have a line of authority duly established from any legally recognized Native American Church or conquering government-recognized tribe.
